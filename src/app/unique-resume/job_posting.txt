Susquehanna is one of the world’s largest market makers, with a unique approach to technology, trading, and research. While this background puts us at the top of our game, what really makes us successful is our cutting-edge technology, collaboration between our technologists and traders, and our decision making. 

  

As a Software Development Summer Intern at Susquehanna, you will be working with senior technologists from the beginning of your programme who will act as your mentors throughout. Your internship programme will allow you to get involved with the development teams building cutting-edge technologies throughout your ten weeks with us. 

  

You will be working with Software Developers who have a constant focus on evolving a stable, scalable, optimized environment with minimized risk. Our growing team of analysts, developers, infrastructure engineers and support specialists design, deliver and optimize industry leading technical solutions that can process large amounts of data, ensuring high performance and stability. 
What we’re looking for

Who you are: 

  

Technical: You have strong software development skills in any object-oriented language (we use C#, C++ & Python mostly). You also understand algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented design patterns. 

  

Problem Solver: When it comes to solving problems, you use clear and sound reasoning. You’re rational and like to use numbers and data to come up with sensible solutions. 

  

Curious: You’re eager to learn and develop new technologies. You’re inquisitive and creative, questioning the status quo. 

  

Communicator: You enjoy building relationships with those you work closely with. You enjoy sharing ideas, expressing your thoughts, and listening to the views of others. 

  

Ambitious: You constantly set yourself goals in life and give your all to achieve them. You’re not afraid to put in the effort to reach your full potential. 

 

 

What’s in it for you: 

  

Education: We are renowned for our market-leading education and training programmes. During your ten-week internship with us, you will take part in a structured program, composed of trading education, shadowing opportunities, coding challenges, projects and workshops. Getting a “big picture” perspective of our technology is important. You will also join industry lectures to understand trading and delve deeper into the crucial role that technologists play in Susquehanna.  

  

Real Impact: Through a combination of hands-on and classroom discussion, you will learn how we solve the real technical challenges of building and maintaining the best trading systems. You will learn about our use of leading-edge hardware and software technologies. With other developers and traders, you will collaborate on live challenges, improvements, and technical issues which are key to the ongoing success of the business. 

  

Culture: Our non-hierarchical culture allows employees of every level to thrive. We are not your typical trading firm – the environment is casual, collaborative and we focus on continuous development, no matter how long you’ve been in Susquehanna. 

  

Perks: Based in the heart of Ireland’s Financial Services Centre, and a 10-minute walk from Dublin’s city centre, our employees avail of free onsite catering, a games room, and a large in house gym, to name but a few of our favourite perks. You will have the opportunity to attend multiple social events hosted by Susquehanna, where you will get the opportunity to meet recent graduates, and senior leaders from across the business. The interns have a social activity every week!
